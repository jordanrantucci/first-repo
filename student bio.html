        <p>I am Jordan Rantucci a 31 year old microbiologist living in Eastlake, Ohio.  I have had an interest in coding for the last few years, but have not had a chance to dive into it.
            I have finally taken the plunge due to COVID to have the time to learn the skill.  A few things I like to do for fun are stay active with hikes and bike rides.
            I love to travel and would like to see as much of the world as possible.  I also love to challenge myself and I feel like learning to code will be a difficult, but rewarding challenge.
